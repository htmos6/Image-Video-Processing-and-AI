1) Download the dataset using Keras.

2) Use matplotlib to view an image from the data set. It can be any image from the data set.

3) Preprocessing the Data
*  Normalize the X train and X test data by dividing by the max value of the image arrays.

4) Reshape the X arrays to include a 4 dimension of the single channel. Similar to what we did for the numbers MNIST data set.

5) Convert the y_train and y_test values to be one-hot encoded for categorical analysis by Keras.

6) Building Model
*  Use Keras to create a model consisting of at least the following layers (but feel free to experiment)

7) compile the model with these parameters: loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='rmsprop', metrics=['accuracy'] / Parameters can be adjusted accordingly.

8) Training the Model
*  Train/Fit the model to the x_train set. Amount of epochs is up to you.

9) Evaluating the Model
Show the accuracy,precision,recall,f1-score the model achieved on the x_test data set. Keep in mind, there are quite a few ways to do this,
but we recommend following the same procedure we showed in the MNIST lecture.
